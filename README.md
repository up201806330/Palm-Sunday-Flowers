Small gift project made in an afternoon as a *Palm Sunday* gift.

*These you dont have to water*

Code **heavily** inspired by [SimonDev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEwhtpXrg5MmwlH04ANpL8A)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feNVBEPXAcE&ab_channel=SimonDev).
Basically just sloppily wrote a better interface for mobile and a randomizer with values to make some pretty flowers.
